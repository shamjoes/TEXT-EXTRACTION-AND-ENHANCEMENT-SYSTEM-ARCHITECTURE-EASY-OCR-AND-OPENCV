# TEXT-DETECTION-AND-EXTRACTION-WITH-TEXT-TRANSLATION-AND-TEXT-TO-SPEECH-
Deep learning enables a unified system for text detection, translation, and text-to-speech synthesis. Using models like EasyOCR, the system extracts text from images, translates it into multiple languages, and converts it into natural-sounding speech—enhancing accessibility and global communication.
This project leverages the power of deep learning to create an integrated system that performs text detection, translation, and text-to-speech synthesis from images. By combining these capabilities, the system enhances accessibility and communication across different languages and user needs.

Features 📷 Text Detection & Extraction Uses EasyOCR to detect and extract text from images with high precision and robustness.

🌐 Translation Engine Supports multilingual translation of extracted text, enabling content to be understood by a global audience.

🔊 Text-to-Speech Synthesis Converts translated text into natural-sounding speech using advanced TTS models, offering auditory access to visual information.

Components The system is built around three core modules:

Text Detection and Extraction Utilizes EasyOCR to identify and extract text from a variety of image sources.

Multilingual Translation Translates the extracted text into one or more target languages using deep learning-based translation APIs or models (e.g., Google Translate API, etc.).

Text-to-Speech (TTS) Converts the translated text into speech using TTS models such as Google Text-to-Speech, Tacotron, or pyttsx3.
